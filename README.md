# Assignment 3: Taking Slides
Your third assignment is designed to help you feel more comfortable with JavaScript and jQuery, while giving you a chance to demonstrate what you have learned about user interface design.
You will be designing, building, and documenting, by yourself, a widget inspired by the work described in ​[T. Moscovich, Contact Area Interaction with Sliding Widgets, ​Proc. UIST 2009​, Victoria, BC, 2009, 13–22​](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1622176.1622181) (and associated ​[video](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1622176.1622181​)), which we discussed in class on October 23. You will then be showing off multiple instances of your widget in a webpage that you will design and implement in HTML/CSS/JavaScript to demonstrate the advantages of your widget when applied to a task of your choosing.

## Design
The widget that you design should be ​inspired​ by the “Sliding Widgets” work and the ideas that it embodies. That is, we would like you to develop a widget that is not merely a copy of something in the paper or video. Rather, the goal is to apply, in your own design, some of the paper's ideas about issues such as easy acquisition and disambiguation of small targets, simultaneous interaction with multiple widgets whose active areas can overlap, or determination of function based on a directional gesture. You should begin by reading through the paper and watching the video again. Then, start thinking about possible ideas and trying them out by using some of the lo-fi prototyping techniques discussed in class and used in Assignment 2. In other words, you should sketch and explore your ideas ​before​ you begin coding!

## Widget and Application
Your new widget should use one of the ​[jQuery UI widgets](​http://jqueryui.com/) and ​[extend](https://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/extending-widgets/) it​ using the ​[jQuery UI Widget Factory​](https://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/). Your new widget class should be implemented as a separate .js file in your directory. From a UI design perspective, you will need to figure out how you want your widget to function and look, and how to make it work.

To demonstrate the advantages of your widget, you should create a webpage that uses multiple instances of your widget class. If at all possible, one of your goals in building the application is to show the advantages of your widget over currently available jQuery widgets for some specific task.

When designing your application, please consider carefully how you will lay out the display, and how it might change over time. You should also aim to make your application as "self-disclosing" as you can. That is, your goal is to make it as easy as you can for a computer-knowledgeable user who has never seen your program before to be able to determine quickly how to use it.
In addition to jQuery, you are welcome to use any of the frameworks we allowed in Assignment 1:
- ​HTML5 Boilerplate 
- Bootstrap
- ​Foundation
